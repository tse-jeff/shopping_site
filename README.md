# shopping_site
This is a proof of concept for demonstrating React and Redux

It's just a simple React shopping site that manages the quantity and other things as states 
with the help of Redux.
I worked on it with the help of my mentor at the NYC Department of Transportation Internship.
The repo was copied onto my github.
